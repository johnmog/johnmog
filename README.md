Hi 👋 I'm John — a Principal Software Engineer at GitHub working on [Copilot X](https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x) to bring AI-powered software development to people everywhere. Previously I worked on the amazing teams that built GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, the original Kinect, and Halo Wars. Outside of work I love to spend time with my wife and two kids, lift weights, play guitar, cook, read, and play games. 

## How I work
I am an engineering leader solving complex technical and non-technical problems, role modeling engineering excellence, and building strong teams through promoting positive culture and collaboration. I've got 8 years of management experience, including teams of up to 300, and believe that leadership can happen from any seat.

🍎 Learn every day<br>
🤓 Authenticity<br>

🤝 Community<br>
🚀 Build things that last<br>
